					<h2>Finn McCool</h2>
					<p>Ace pilot Finn McCool is graduate of the R.A.A.F's Red Arrows aerobatic stunt team and has served in combat choppers in three recent wars. He fears nothing but small dogs and single women and knows how to show a lady a good time.</p>
					<p>McCool owns an Extra EA-200 aerobatic plane for the ultimate stunt flight experience, and flies all of our other fixed wing aircraft much more sedately when required. A real "ice man", McCool is his real name and he's Irish and he doesn't want to talk about it.</p>

					<h2>Wendy "Dropper" Gilhallen</h2>
					<p>Already a veteran with 13 years of commercial pilot experience in Africa, Russia and South America, Wendy is genuine adventurer who can handle herself in a crisis having survived three last ditch landings in the wild.</p>
					<p>Wendy owns a Cessna-172 Skyhawk P that is ideal for low level sight seeing. Wendy rides a harley and is a ski instructor during the seasan but she's no powder puff and shows the boys how it's done on the slopes and in the air.</p>

					<h2>John "Doc" Holliday</h2>	
					<p>With over 10,000 hours piloting helicopters in the bush and mountains of the Southern Alps for deer recovery and mountain rescue operations, Doc is well qualified to land you and your friends in remote parts of the country that only he knows about.</p>
					<p>Doc will help you plot your route, drop extra provisions where you want them, and will pick you up when you are done. A true southern man, tougher than teak with a heart of gold, you can count on Doc to get the job done.</p>

					<img src="img/hans-400x300.jpg" alt="man checking controls in helicopter on the ground">
					<h2>Hans Gerhansen</h2>
					<p>Hans has flown almost everything there is to fly. He first took the controls of a small plane at 12 years old, and flew solo when he was 14. After  a few years flying "anything, anywhere" he took a few test pilot jobs, but left that because he prefers company inflight.</p>
					<p>Hans doesn't actually own his own plane right now, unless you count the microlight. You will find him in the pilots seat of any of our aircraft when he's not skiing, tramping, climbing, hang gliding or performing with his backup band at the local hotel.</p>

				<article class="pilots-planes">
					<img src="img/stunt-plane-400x300.jpg" alt="stunt plane flying over water with smoke trail behind it">
					<h2>Extra EA-200 Aerobatic Plane</h2>
					<p> The Extra EA-200 is powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Lycoming engine and offers all of the the flying characteristics of its big brother, the EA-300, and is capable of all unlimited maneuvers. With a maximum speed of 396 km/h or 217 kts (248 mph) and a maneuvering speed of 154 kts, this mean machine takes it to the limit.</p>

				<article class="pilots-planes">
					<img src="img/cessna-caravan-400x300.jpg" alt="seaplane on the water">
					<h2>Cessna Caravan Amphibian</h2>
					<p>With a crew of one or two and capacity for 9 passengers,  the Cessna Caravan is powered by a Pratt &amp Whitney PT6A-140 turboprop with 868 hp (647 kW) for a cruise speed of 213 mph or (185 kn; 343 km/h) true air speed. Fitted with pontoon landing gear, this aircraft can easily land on any decent sized lake.

					<h2>Cessna 172 Skyhawk P</h2>	
					<p>The Cessna 172 Skyhawk P is a four-seat fixed-wing aircraft made by the Cessna Aircraft Company and powered by a Lycoming O-320 engine with 160 horsepower. First flown in 1955, more Cessna 172s have been built than any other aircraft making it arguably the most successful light civilian aircraft in history. A proven performer.</p>

					<img src="img/cessna-turbo-stationair-400x300.jpg" alt="cessna propeller plane parked up on the ground">
					<h2>Cessna Turbo Stationair</h2>
					<p>The combination of a powerful 300 hp (220 kW) Continental IO-520-F engine, rugged construction and a large cabin has made the Cessna Turbo Stationair an ideal bush plane for over 50 years. Cessna calls it the sport-utility vehicle of the air and we agree wholeheartedly. A genuine workhorse and an ideal glider tow vehicle for the DG-1001s.</p>

				<article class="pilots-planes">
					<img src="img/dg1000-glider-400x300.jpg" alt="glider in flight in clear blue sky">
					<h2>DG Flugzeugbau DG-1001s Glider</h2>
					<p>The DG-1001s is an excellent trainer ideal for aerobatic or cross-country flying. It comes standard without the nose wheel but with a very high spring mounted electric main wheel with disc brake, tail wheel, and removable 20 meter wingtip extensions with winglets. It also has 160 litre water balast tanks in the wings and a fin tank. An exceptional aircraft.

					<img src="img/helo1-alps-400x300.jpg" alt="helicopter landing on a mountain">
					<h2>AS350 (Eurocopter ‘Squirrel’) Helicopter</h2>
					<p>The AS350 helicopter has a carrying capacity of 6 passengers plus the pilot and has gear lockers. It can be fitted with pods and has a lifting capacity of 1.2 to 1.4 tonnes. Extremely stable and manoeuverable these great little choppers will get you and your gear anywhere you need to be in a hurry. A little champion.
